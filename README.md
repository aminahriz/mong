# mong
This is Aminah Rizwan and Wanning He's submission for MasseyHacks Seven. 
Mongo is a program that automatically sends emails to the MPP representative of an Ontarian user's area(riding), regarding provincial issues. The aim of this program is to make residents more engaged in local issues, and to ensure that their voice is heard, by removing all barriers from the process of making your voice heard. The inspiration for this program came from our own expereinces with contacting our representatives. We didn't know who they were, how to get in touch with them, or what to say. This really discouraged us, and demotivated us from making our voices heard, and so, we decided to create this program.
Aminah Rizwan is the researcher and programmer for this project. 
Wanning He is in charge of media and created the template for the emails, among other things.
